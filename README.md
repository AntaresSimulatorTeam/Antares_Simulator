Antares Simulator is an open source power system simulator meant to be
used by anybody placing value in quantifying the adequacy or the 
economic performance of interconnected power systems, at short or 
remote time horizons: 

Transmission system Operators, Power Producers, Regulators, Academics,
Consultants, NGO and all others actors concerned by energy policy issues
are welcome to use the software.

The Antares Simulator project was initiated by RTE (French Electricity 
Transmission system Operator) in 2007. It was developed from the start
as a cross-platform application (Windows, GNU/Linux ,Unix). 

Until 2018 it was distributed under the terms of a proprietary license.

In May 2018 RTE decided to release the project under the GPLv3 license.

The GUI is deprecated in favor of [Antares Web](https://github.com/AntaresSimulatorTeam/AntaREST).
