    MPS and criterion generated files wear the same time interval sequence in their names.
    This time interval sequence is either <year>-<week> (for a weekly optimization),
    or <year>-<week>-<day> (for a daily optimization).
    So, depending on whether the optimization is weekly or daily, the files are named either :
    - problem-<year>-<week>--optim-nb-<n>.mps
    - problem-<year>-<week>-<day>--optim-nb-<n>.mps

    The following class hierarchy intend to represent these time interval sequences (weekly or
   daily), and it turns them into a string when building the names of the previous files. This
   hierarchy is designed for polymorphism : whetever the time interval an object of that hierarchy
   represents, it is passed as a base class argument, and the right 'to_string()' function is
   called.
