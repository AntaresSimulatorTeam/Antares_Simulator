DBI Module
==========

Yuni module for Database Management.

This module is an abstraction layer on relational databases.
It offers wrappers for connecting to and manipulating databases.

Currently, only an SQLite back-end is available but the module is built
specifically for extensibility so that other back-ends can be added
painlessly in the future.
