Smart Pointer
=============

Yuni's implementation of smart pointers is based on Andrei Alexandrescu's
_Modern Compiler Design_ but offers a simplified and customized approach.
Apart from the intrinsic value of automatic memory management, the most
important aspect of *Yuni::SmartPtr* is the effortless thread-safety it
provides.
