Functional
==========

This is a set of functional-style features, meant to abstract away collection
manipulation into functional *folds*, *maps*, and *filters*.

*Views* are compatible with most STL containers as well as C-style arrays,
char*, and of course *Yuni::String* as either a byte string or a UTF-8 string.
