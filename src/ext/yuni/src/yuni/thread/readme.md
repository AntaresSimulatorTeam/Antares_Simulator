Thread Module
=============

Yuni module for Multithreading.

This module allows you to create threads, and offers all the usual
synchronization tools, i.e. mutexes, semaphores, signals, as well as some
higher-level tools that rely on threads, like timers and the awesome *spawn*,
*async* and *every*.
