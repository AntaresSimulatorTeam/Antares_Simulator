If you think about contributing to the Antares_Simulator project, your first move should be to get the source code.
There are two ways to achieve that:

1) Clone the Antares_Simulator git repository available on GitHub : (link to be added)
2) Get an Antares_Simulator installer package available at https://antares-simulator@rte-france.com 
and tick the box "copy source code"  when installing the software.   
 
In the process followed to release the code of Antares_Simulator under Open Source, there are two important milestones:

* In Summer 2018 , release of Antares_Simulator 6.0.0 : this first (ex-post) publication is meant to
provide a general access to the code, giving to everybody the ability to review as well as to (re)build the application.
At this stage, however, all will not be set yet regarding how to contribute (this file), conduct code, coding conventions, etc.

* In Winter 2018/2019, release of Antares_Simulator 7.0.0 source. With this version will start the actual open
developement process, no more code being written in proprietary mode. This publication is meant to give the actual kick-off
for external contributions.

* During the interim period (second  half of 2018), developers who wish to join are welcome to examine
the code already published and to share their thoughts with the Antares_Simulator Team through one of
the email addresses that can be found at https://antares-simulator@rte-france.com
