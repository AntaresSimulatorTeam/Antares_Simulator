# Build
Before building, make sure that dependencies are [installed](2-Dependencies-install.md).

## Environment settings

On CentOS, install developer tools, and enable `devtoolset-10` and `rh-git227`:
```
sudo yum install git redhat-lsb-core gcc gcc-c++ make wget centos-release-scl scl-utils rpm-build
sudo yum install cmake3 devtoolset-10-gcc*

scl enable devtoolset-9 bash
source /opt/rh/rh-git227/enable
```

## Install VCPKG

Although you may install third party dependencies yourself, the preferred way is 
to rely on [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) and its CMake integration
to build and install most of them.

The first step will be to install VCPKG using its bootstrap script:

=== "Windows"

    ```
    git submodule update --init vcpkg
    cd vcpkg
    .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
    ```

=== "Linux"

    ```
    git submodule update --init vcpkg
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ```

## Configure build with CMake

The preferred way of building the project is to use a pre-compiled version of OR-Tools and to install
other dependencies using vcpkg. To achieve this, you will need to define VCPKG-related variables,
and add your OR-tools install path to `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`:


=== "Windows"

    ```
    cmake -B _build -S src -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake \
                           -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-antares \
                           -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
                           -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=</path/to/or-tools>
    ```

    > **Note:** cpack NSIS installer creation needs an 'out-of-source build'. The build directory must be outside `src` directory


=== "Linux"

    ```
    cmake -B _build -S src -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake \
                           -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-linux-antares \
                           -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
                           -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=</path/to/or-tools>
    ```

Here is a list of mandatory or optional CMake configuration options:

> ðŸ’¡ **Disable the UI build to make builds faster**  
> The UI takes up a good chunk of compilation time. It is enabled by default, but you can disable it by turning off `BUILD_UI`

> ðŸ’¡ **Use Ninja to speed up target generation by CMake**  
> At configure time, you may specify Ninja for generation instead of traditional Make. This will speed up the update
> step after you make small changes to the code.
> ```
> cmake -S src [...] -G Ninja

> Note that you may need to install Ninja first (package `ninja-build` on Ubuntu).

## Build
=== "Windows"

    ```
    cmake --build _build --config Release -j8
    ```
=== "CentOS"

    ```
    cmake3 --build _build -j8
    ```
=== "Ubuntu/Debian"

    ```
    cmake --build _build -j8
    ```

> ðŸ’¡ Compilation can be done on several processors with `-j` option.
  

The final GUI file can be executed at `_build/ui/simulator/antares-X.Y-ui-simulator`

## Developer experience tips

> ðŸ’¡ **Ignore submodules to make git operations faster**  
> Antares_Simulator is quite a large project, with a few large submodules. In file .git/config, you can add this line to all [submodule] sections
> ```
> ignore = all
> ```
> This way git won't waste time computing diff on these when checking out, diffing commits, etc. git operations should be a lot faster.
> Keep in mind that your submodules won't be updated.
