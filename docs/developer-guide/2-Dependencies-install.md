# Dependencies install

*Antares Simulator* depends on some mandatory libraries.

- [Sirius Solver](https://github.com/AntaresSimulatorTeam/sirius-solver/tree/Antares_VCPKG) (fork from [RTE](https://github.com/rte-france/sirius-solver/tree/Antares_VCPKG))
- [OR-Tools](https://github.com/rte-france.com/or-tools) (fork from [Google](https://github.com/google/or-tools))
  (Only for the complete Antares Simulator solution with GUI)
- [minizip](https://github.com/zlib-ng/minizip-ng) library, with its dependency zlib
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) libraries: header libraries and boost-test library
- [libuuid](https://linux.die.net/man/3/libuuid) on Linux systems

We favor using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for building and installing most of those dependencies,
see [build instructions](3-Build.md) which explain how it integrates with CMake build.
However, we still have a few exceptions that must be installed in a different way, see next sections.

Although not encouraged, it's still possible to install those dependencies yourself and add
their installation path to your `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.

## OR-Tools

OR-Tools may be installed in one of 2 ways:

1. **As a pre-compiled dependency**

    You can [download](https://github.com/rte-france/or-tools/releases) a precompiled OR-Tools archive that contains headers & static libraries.

    Please note that dynamic linking with OR-Tools is only supported in Linux.

    Decompress the archive, and provide its path as a `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.

2. **As part of the build**

    You may enable the `BUILD_ORTOOLS` configuration option to build it from source during Antares build,
    as documented in [build instructions](3-Build.md).

    The drawback of this second approach is that OR-Tools may need to be built again when you
    run again a cmake configure step, therefore it's not advised for developers.


## Linux: libuuid

On Linux systems, libuuid development packages need to be installed with your
OS package manager.

=== "Centos"

    ```
    sudo yum install libuuid-devel
    ```

=== "Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 / Debian 11"

    ```
    sudo apt install uuid-dev
    ```

=== "Ubuntu 23.04 / Debian 12"

    ```
    sudo apt install uuid-dev
    ```
