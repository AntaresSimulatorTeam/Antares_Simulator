**Executable**: antares-study-cleaner (currently released for Windows & Ubuntu only)

#### Note about the "user" subdirectory
*Antares* is not allowed to delete any files from the "user" subdirectory of the study directory. 
As a consequence, the "user" subdirectory is unaffected by the Study Cleaner.
