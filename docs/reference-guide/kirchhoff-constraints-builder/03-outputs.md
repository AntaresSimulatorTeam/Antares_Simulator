# Output files

5. The outputs of the Antares Kirchhoff's constraints generator are not printed in the general output files
   but kept within the input files structure, the reason being that they are input data for the proper Antares simulation.
   The associated data (so-called binding constraints bearing in their name the prefix "@UTO-") may nonetheless
   be accessed to be reviewed, updated and deleted at any time through the GUI.
